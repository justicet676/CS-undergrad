How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Creating user stories helps to concisely list the users needs and wants for a project, instead of having to parse through what could dozens of pages of feedback over the course of a project. 

 How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs I like to make a list of things that need to be done and slowly make my way through them, testing throughout the way. This follows typical agile processes already. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To do your share of the work.

The project 'finale.docx' was made to take a file and output word frequencies using the 'map' function in c++. I really like the class I made for the system and I think it utilized private vs public functions well. I think I would create a seperate function for copying the text from the file if I was to edit the code more. I had a hard time getting input vs output files to work at first, but it was more because I had no idea where to place the file. I found the class hard to write, and it took alot of trial and error, but I think I understand them better now. I tried to include comments to make my code make more sense, as well as keeping my code grouped and organized well. I think the map function and class data I utilized will come in use in future assignments.

The DriverPass project was for a client who wanted to create a drivers education project that was done through a private buisness rather than a school. So the student drivers would sign up for certain driving 'packages' to complete to learn to drive before they took their driver's liscense test. Experienced drivers also would sign up to teach student drivers during certain time frames. I don't think I did anything on the project particularly well, I'm not very proud of my work on it and I wish I could redo all of it. I don't know how I would improve it, I think that I needed time to think on the project that due to other problems I did not have. I tried to incorporate the need for security and ease of access into the site, I didn't want to use two-step verification or constant password resets because I feel that they are very frustrating to an end user and if you don't make a site easy to use people are unlikely to use it. Youu need to think of a user's needs because if you make a site, no matter how good, and it doesn't fit anyone's needs, no one is going to use it. To design the software I wrote down all the big parts on a piece of paper and then scribbled notes smaller and smaller to branch off of the main 'object', this is how I usually code as well, and it tends to help me keep track of what is related to what, similar to a UML class diagram.
