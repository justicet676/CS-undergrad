How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Creating user stories helps to concisely list the users needs and wants for a project, instead of having to parse through what could dozens of pages of feedback over the course of a project. 

 How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs I like to make a list of things that need to be done and slowly make my way through them, testing throughout the way. This follows typical agile processes already. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To do your share of the work.
